To install Typogrify, move the entire "typogrify" directory into your Drupal
installation's modules folder.


Enable the module:

Administration -> Extend


Add it as a filter to an existing Text format:

Go to Administration -> Configuration -> Content authoring -> Text formats and editors and then click configure next to the format you'd like to add it to.

For starters, you probably just want to add this filter to your default text
format. Typogrify expects html input so it should be be the last filter you
apply (ie, after Markdown). Typogrify will not work as expected if it is
applied to plain text, or if it is the only filter applied to the text.


Choose which typographic refinements to apply:

Administer -> Configuration -> Content authoring -> Text formats and editors -> [Your Input Format] -> Configure
